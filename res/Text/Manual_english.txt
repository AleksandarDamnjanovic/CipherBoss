Cipher Boss is directed towards easy to use and friendly interface. Basically you have to know very few things about cryptography in order to use this tool.%%%%%First, you need key. Cryptographic key is necessary in order to encrypt or decrypt your data. There are many kinds of keys out there. For the sake of simplicity, here, we are using symmetric key(same key encrypts and decrypts data), AES 256 algorithm, to process data.%%%%%You can get this key in many ways. You can generate one or many using this app or you can import key already generated in some other application. You can manage and use those keys by Cipher Boss as long they are generated using AES 256 algorithm. There is one more thing to say about keys. You need the same key for encryption and decryption. You can't use different key to decrypt encrypted content. If you somehow lose the key you have used to encrypt some data, and you didn't create backup... it's really bad luck.%%%%%Second thing you need is content. You can simple open you favorite file explorer, navigate to the content, drag and drop it into Cipher Boss terminal. Once loaded, create or import key, or set default key if you have many, and press encrypt button. Dialog will pop up, and confirm your decision. All information about this process you can find in Cipher Boss terminal space. Once done, you will be able to find encrypted files in your default directory. Decryption is done in the same way. No need to say that you can process more that one file at once.%%%%%If you like this app, there are Cipher Boss for android devices. For that and many other informations click on button Links. Enjoy :-)
